The task was completed up to the point of inserting personal data.

The code runs locally and works correctly. The extension is installed each time, and the entire flow is written for incognito mode.

A Page-object was created, and Page and NewContext were overridden to work with the MetaMask plugin.

MetaMask is installed, but I didn't add personal data or create an account.

CI/CD failed at the step of opening MetaMask, and adding a screenshot did not produce a positive result.

It took 3 hours to complete the work.
